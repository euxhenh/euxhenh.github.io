Hello!

I'm a Research Scientist working in the intersection of Machine Learning
and Biotechnology at <a href="https://genbio.ai">GenBio AI</a>. I am broadly
interested in senescence/aging, drug design, graph learning, generative
models, and biological foundation models.

I completed my PhD in <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine
Learning</a> from <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon
University</a>, where I was advised by <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/">Ziv Bar-Joseph</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnab&aacute;s P&oacute;czos</a>.
My thesis focused on applying machine learning to biomarker discovery,
specifically targeting cellular senescence (a driver of aging). I also have
an MS in Machine Learning from CMU and a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics from AUBG.

Previously, I spent some time at <a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en">Sanofi</a> and
<a href="https://genesistherapeutics.ai">Genesis Therapeutics</a> where I
worked on drug discovery.
