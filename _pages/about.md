Hello!

I'm a <b>PhD candidate</b> in <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning</a>
at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a>,
advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/">Ziv Bar-Joseph</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnab&aacute;s P&oacute;czos</a>.
My research interests lie in the intersection of `Artificial Intelligence` and `Biotechnology`, in particular,
<a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/A-Brief-Guide-to-Genomics">genomics</a>.
I am also interested in unsupervised learning, non-convex optimization, deep learning, and art.

I completed a <b>Master of Science</b> in Machine Learning at CMU working under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/">Ziv Bar-Joseph</a> and <a href="https://www.meakinsmcgill.com/ding/">Jun Ding</a>.
Before that, I earned a <b>Bachelor of Arts</b> degree from <a href="https://www.aubg.edu/">AUBG</a>, double majoring
in Computer Science and Mathematics.
