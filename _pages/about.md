Hello!

I'm a Research Scientist working in the intersection of Machine Learning
and Biotechnology at <a href="https://genbio.ai">GenBio AI</a>. I hold a PhD in <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine
Learning</a> from <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon
University</a>, where I was
advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/">Ziv Bar-Joseph</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnab&aacute;s P&oacute;czos</a>.
I am interested in senescence/aging, drug design, graph learning, generative models, and biological foundation models.
